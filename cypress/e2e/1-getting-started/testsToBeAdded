/* 


- Performance test
- Item Filtration
- Item Search
- There are multiple bugs found along the testing:

The application allows the user to place an order without selecting any of the items
The QTY cannot to changed (the user is unable to purchase two of the same items in the same order)
The user is unable to remove items from “check out part two” 

Item3 ID contains unsupported characters such as  () , 


Thought of improvements: 

could create a loop for each user type to run the tests automatically for each user 
should've used a builder to create multiple classes instead of declaring them.
